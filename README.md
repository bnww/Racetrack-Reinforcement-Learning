# Reinforcement Learning
### Assignment submitted for University of Bath AI Master's course.
Achieved high distinction for this work (84/100).

Implementation and comparison of three reinforcement learning algorithms implemented from scratch: **On-Policy First-Visit Monte-Carlo Control**, **Sarsa**, and **Q-Learning**.
Algorithms are tested in a racetrack environment, with the aim of training an agent to complete the race course at speed without hitting the walls.

## Repo
Environment is coded in `racetrack_env`
`track.txt` encodes the layout of the track.
Code for RL algorithm implementations is shown in `rl_agents.ipynb`, including a thorough discussion of the differences between the algorithms, optimization techniques, and the final results.
